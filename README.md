    * I'm interviewing all CS1 professors to get this

  * Left Panel has Table of Contents
    * Broken down by Week of whole semester
    * Each week has Overview of concepts, projects, and reading assignments - I'll get all info on this
  * Body of page has generic approach to programming -> links to "Fundamentals Page"
